## General Remarks
If you intend to become a Pulsechain validator, wisely consider your ambitions. Becoming a pulsechain validator is imperative for building up a sustainable and stable pulsechain blockchain infrastructure.

Nobody want to see pulsechain validators that are not capable of bringing back their nodes after facing minor issues. Note that you need to be skilled in hardware and software managemenet, in particular Linux system administration and engineering, redundancy management and system automation, especially relevant if you run into issues and incidents on mainnet. Learn everything relevant about journaling and copy-on-write filesystems for software RAID management and snapshots.

You also need to gain networking and security skills, knowing how to protect your system. Also acquire skills in high availability computing and gain knowledge in remote system administration as well e.g. using SSH and GNU Screen to remotely re-connect to detached pulsechain docker sessions. Learn more about Docker and containers as well, perhaps you start with '$ man chroot' in order to understandd container basics.

In order to protect your staked funds on pulsechain mainnet, download respective HOWTOS, Manuals and purchase relevant books. Only operate on pulsechain testnet prior to go-live on mainnet and connect yourself with your pulsechain developers peer-group as well in telegram & discord.

## Let's start
If you feel ready to build up your own pulsechain validator node, here I share my scripts with you. Note that this is not a step-by-step manual to build up a pulsechain validator from scratch. There are fantatic sources, e.g. Hodldogs https://hodldog.notion.site/PulseChain-Mainnet-Node-Validator-Guide-390243a66f3449a9a2425db25370ad89
