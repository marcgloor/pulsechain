README for my pulsechain scripts.

If you intend to become a Pulsechain validator, wisely consider your ambition. Becoming a pulsechain validator is imperative for building up a sustainable and stable blockchain infrastructure. 

We don't want to see pulsechain validators that are not capable of brining back their nodes after facing minor issues. Note that you need to be skilled in hardware and software, in particular Linux system administration and engineering, especially relevant if you run into issues and incidents. You also need to gain networking and security skills, knowing how to protect your system. Also acquire skills in high availability computing and gain knowledge in remote system administration as well e.g. using SSH and GNU Screen. Purchase or download respective HOWTOS, Manuals and books, connect yourself with your peer-group as well in telegram and discord.

If you feel ready for proceed building up your Pulsechain validator node, here I share my scripts with you.
